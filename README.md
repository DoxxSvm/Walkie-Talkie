# Walkie-Talkie Application 🎙️📡  

Welcome, developers and GitHub visitors!  

I'm **Harsh Kumar Singh**, the creator of this **Walkie-Talkie** application, inspired by a series where soldiers communicated using traditional walkie-talkies. That concept sparked an idea—why not bring the same experience into a modern app? 🚀  

## 📌 About the App  
This application enables real-time communication using **WebRTC** technology, allowing users to:  
✅ **Send text messages** 💬  
✅ **Start video calls** 📹  
✅ **Initiate audio calls** 🎧  

WebRTC facilitates **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) streaming**, where a single host can stream, and multiple users can join as viewers. This ensures efficient video and audio transmission with minimal latency.

## ✨ Key Features  
- 🚀 **Splash Screen** for a smooth app launch  
- 🔑 **Onboarding Screen** to generate user credentials  
- 🏠 **Home Screen** displaying locally stored users  
- ➕ **Add Contact** functionality  
- ❌ **Delete Contact** feature  
- 🔔 **FCM Service** for push notifications  
- 💬 **Text Messaging** for instant communication  
- 📹 **Video Messaging** using WebRTC  
- 🎧 **Voice Messaging** for walkie-talkie-style interaction  
- 🔐 **End-to-End Encrypted Environment** for secure communication  
- 🌐 **WebRTC-based Communication** for real-time audio/video streaming  
- 🖥️ **System-Wide Overlay** to display received messages  
- 📋 **Copy ID** feature for easy sharing  
- 🎨 **Clean UI** with Jetpack Compose and a well-structured architecture

## 🚀 Future Considerations  
- 🛡 **Advanced Blocking Mechanism**: Implementing features like auto-reject, spam detection, and customizable block settings.  
- 📡 **Network Adaptation**: Enhancing WebRTC performance in low-bandwidth environments.  
- 🔄 **Message Sync & Backup**: Cloud-based message storage for device switching.  
- 🏷 **User Presence Indicator**: Show when a contact is online or offline.  
- 🆘 **Emergency Communication Mode**: Quick-access mode for critical situations.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1️⃣ **Launching the App:**  
   - Upon opening, the app presents an interface where users can swipe a button to generate credentials.  

2️⃣ **Adding Contacts:**  
   - Tap the **"Add Contact"** button at the bottom.  
   - Enter the unique **Walkie-Talkie ID** of the other user and save it.  
   - Assign a name to the contact (stored in a local Room database).  

3️⃣ **Communication Options:** Each contact appears on the home screen with three interaction buttons:  
   - 📩 **Text Message:** Opens a chat interface for typing and sending messages.  
   - 📹 **Video Message:** Initiates a WebRTC-based video call.  
   - 🎧 **Audio Message:** Starts a WebRTC-based audio conversation.  

4️⃣ **Message Delivery:**  
   - Messages and calls are transmitted securely using WebRTC, ensuring seamless real-time communication.
